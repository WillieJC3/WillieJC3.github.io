<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p> I am a first year student at the University of Texas at Austin studying Business and Government. Once I graduate, I plan on going to law school and I want to eventually practice corporate law. Growing up, my mom was in the United States Navy; I have had the opportunity to live in North and South Carolina along with Virginia and now Texas. <p>
